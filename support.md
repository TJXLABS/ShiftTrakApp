  ## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

  ### General

  **Q: Is ShiftTrak free?**
  A: Yes! ShiftTrak has free core features. PRO features (PDF export, custom themes, advanced analytics) are available through a one-time purchase.

  **Q: Is my data safe?**
  A: Absolutely. All your data is stored locally on your device. We never upload your shifts or earnings to the cloud.

  **Q: Do I need to create an account?**
  A: No! ShiftTrak requires no sign-up, no email, no account.

  **Q: Will my data be backed up?**
  A: No. Since all data is stored locally, you should export your data regularly as CSV/PDF backups. We're working on backup/restore features for future updates.

  ### Features

  **Q: How do I export my shifts?**
  A: PDF and CSV export are PRO features. Go to Analytics > Export to generate reports.

  **Q: Can I track multiple jobs?**
  A: Yes! Create multiple wage presets for different employers or pay rates.

  **Q: How accurate are the tax calculations?**
  A: Tax estimates use 2024-2025 Australian tax brackets. They're estimates only - consult a tax professional for accuracy.

  **Q: Can I attach photos to shifts?**
  A: Yes! Tap the camera icon when adding/editing a shift to attach receipts or rosters.

  ### PRO Features

  **Q: How do I unlock PRO features?**
  A: Early adopters (users who install during the promotional period) get lifetime PRO access at a discounted rate. The upgrade prompt will appear in the app.

  **Q: What if I uninstall the app?**
  A: Your PRO status is tied to your device. If you uninstall, you may need to re-purchase. (Cloud sync coming soon!)

  **Q: Can I get a refund?**
  A: Refunds are handled through Google Play Store. Contact us if you have issues.

  ### Technical

  **Q: What Android version do I need?**
  A: Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher.

  **Q: Is there an iOS version?**
  A: Not yet, but it's on our roadmap!

  **Q: Why can't I see my shifts?**
  A: Check your date filters in the Analytics screen. Make sure you're viewing the correct date range.

  **Q: The app crashed. What should I do?**
  A: Crash reports are sent automatically. Restart the app and email us if the problem persists.
